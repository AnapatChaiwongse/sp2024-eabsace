I like that the teacher gave us advice on how to improve our projects and taught us to really understand lessons.,"[{'term': 'content quality', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"

Explain both Thai and English. Covering the whole lesson. Thank you very much.,"[{'term': 'organization', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
1.2 hours of consecutive studying is too much for me to stay focused. I prefer 2 breaks during a class like [course].,"[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
I want [instructor] to speak clearly,"[{'term': 'content quality', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"Deciding to host onsite classes and her only appearing in online meetings is one of the worst experiences I have ever felt, sure, [instructor] may have health issues but could have hosted online classes. To add an insult to injury, [instructor] expresses dislike to many students because nobody listens to [instructor], but we do have a defense, there's nothing but [instructor] just reading things on the presentation slides so how could we stay focused on what is literally right there in the slide itself? While I do not like to say that [instructor] is redundant and useless, I and many others share the same opinion that there is almost nothing of value in really being engaged in [instructor] class, we have many other things that are important to deal with.","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
The instructor give descriptions and details in class topic very clear,"[{'term': 'content quality', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"Giving assignments every week and group projects almost every week is too excessive, there is too much workload and those assignments are not really helpful for studying the course in my opinion. The group report may be a bit too harsh on minimum pages when there are not enough requirements on what content should be in report.","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
Thank you for teaching this good.,"[{'term': 'instructor', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Many workloads,"[{'term': 'instructor', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"I was also not able to memorize the whole structure and find myself very struggling with the subject. However, one night, through my compassion and a liter of coffee, I decided to revise the material from [course]  from last semester from the beginning focusing on how [topic] works. I find that it is easier for me to study [course] knowing what and how data was sent from each layer.","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
Would like to have a link that can write and edit the group listSo that some students who do not have a group can know that there are no groups and request to join the group with other groups.,"[{'term': 'organization', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

Your teaching styles were easy to understand. (:D),"[{'term': 'content quality', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"I think that the instructor should explain the content in more detail because I was not able to understand several parts of the lectures. Also, I had trouble understanding the content in the slides because the connection between the topics in the slides is not clear and the explanation for several parts is complicated. Each slide introduced a new topic, and I was unable to see the overall picture of the topics and how this slide is related to the previous or the next. Also, as for the explanations, the way that the content is explained is quite confusing and give a clear explanation of the content. Several parts were standalone sentences that were difficult to connect with what the topic is about and the other parts of the explanation. I had to do quite extensive external learning through several websites on the internet to understand several parts of the lectures because I could not understand the explanations provided in the slides. I would like the slides to be better organized and the explanations of the content, both in the slides and when the instructor explains the content, to be clearer and more easily understandable.","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"He didn’t clear to assign homework, and he never adapt himself. i commented he in [subject] in the same problem.","[{'term': 'organization', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

The content at some point is still teaching and does not understand.,"[{'term': 'organization', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
TA is very efficient.,"[{'term': 'content quality', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"Professor received homework in class, so when i get sick i cannot sent the homework properly. I think ajarn should use [software] to sent the homework. It does not make sense that student must send the homework without using [system] while in online session student can send the assignment with tools.","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
Would like the teacher to speak clearlyAnd there are indicators of the details of both the Assignment and the scores of that work.,"[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"

"I would like the instructor to understand that the method of learning which [instructor] teach is not give student enough understanding for most of student in the class. Even thought some student can implement the project as the requirement, it is because he/she have to seek more knowledge outside the class as instructor may have to consider why most of the student in the class cannot reach the requirement of the project, why they cannot delivered the project which using only the knowledge they learned in the class should be enough. As a result, I would love to let the instructor and faculty know that [instructor] is a kind, good person, and [instructor] can give a good advise with a good intention, but sometime it required morethan that to make the good class.","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
"he is a kind person and can be a good advisor, however he is not a good instructor at all since he cannot delivered the knowledge in the class to make the student understand.","[{'term': 'content quality', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"

"It's difficult install [software] on Unix based devices, especially with the modern ARM processors, [software] only supports the x86_64 architecture. I think there are plenty of alternatives that natively support both x86_64 and arm64 chipsets (maybe the ones that are web based or written in java), as running Netica through emulation causes the program to be unstable and crashes alot (Tested on x86_64 Suse Tumbleweed and arm64 Windows, there are cases where my friends with m1 macbooks aren't able to install at all).","[{'term': 'motivation', 'polarity': 'neutral'}]"
