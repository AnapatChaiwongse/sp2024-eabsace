Deciding to host onsite classes and her only appearing in online meetings is one of the worst experiences I have ever felt, sure, [instructor] may have health issues but could have hosted online classes. To add an insult to injury, [instructor] expresses dislike to many students because nobody listens to [instructor], but we do have a defense, there's nothing but [instructor] just reading things on the presentation slides so how could we stay focused on what is literally right there in the slide itself? While I do not like to say that [instructor] is redundant and useless, I and many others share the same opinion that there is almost nothing of value in really being engaged in [instructor] class, we have many other things that are important to deal with.The sentiment polarity of motivation is negative .

Giving assignments every week and group projects almost every week is too excessive, there is too much workload and those assignments are not really helpful for studying the course in my opinion.

I was also not able to memorize the whole structure and find myself very struggling with the subject.

I think that the instructor should explain the content in more detail because I was not able to understand several parts of the lectures. Also, I had trouble understanding the content in the slides because the connection between the topics in the slides is not clear and the explanation for several parts is complicated. Each slide introduced a new topic, and I was unable to see the overall picture of the topics and how this slide is related to the previous or the next. Also, as for the explanations, the way that the content is explained is quite confusing and give a clear explanation of the content. Several parts were standalone sentences that were difficult to connect with what the topic is about and the other parts of the explanation. I had to do quite extensive external learning through several websites on the internet to understand several parts of the lectures because I could not understand the explanations provided in the slides. I would like the slides to be better organized and the explanations of the content, both in the slides and when the instructor explains the content, to be clearer and more easily understandable.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

I would like the instructor to understand that the method of learning which [instructor] teach is not give student enough understanding for most of student in the class. Even thought some student can implement the project as the requirement, it is because he/she have to seek more knowledge outside the class as instructor may have to consider why most of the student in the class cannot reach the requirement of the project, why they cannot delivered the project which using only the knowledge they learned in the class should be enough. As a result, I would love to let the instructor and faculty know that [instructor] is a kind, good person, and [instructor] can give a good advise with a good intention, but sometime it required morethan that to make the good class.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

It's difficult install [software] on Unix based devices, especially with the modern ARM processors, [software] only supports the x86_64 architecture.

I think that the instructor should explain the content in more detail because I could not understand several parts of the conferences. In addition, I had trouble understanding the content in the slides because the connection between the subjects of the slidesis not clear and the explanation of several parts is complicated. Each slide has introduced a new subject, and I could not see the overall image of the subjects and how this slide is linked to the previous or the following.In addition, with regard to the explanations, the way the content is explained is quite confusing and gives a clear explanation of the content. Party parties were independent sentences difficult to connect with what the subject and the other parts of the'Explanation.I had to do external learning fairly extensive via several websites on the internet to understand several parts of the conferences because I could not understand the explanations provided in the slides.

I would like the instructor to understand that the learning method that [the instructor] teaches is not a sufficient understanding of the student for most of the students in the class.

This class is the least pleasant class of this semester. The weekly mission in my opinion is not Nessecary.

I don't understand some parts of the lecture, so I think the instructor needs to explain content in more detail.Also, the connection between topics in the slide was not clear, and some parts were complicated, so I had a hard time understanding the content in the slide.A new topic was introduced on each slide, and it was not possible to see the whole picture of the topic or how this slide was related to the previous or next slides.Regarding the explanation, the method of content is very confusing, providing a clear explanation of content.Some parts were difficult to connect to the contents and other parts of the topic and other parts.I couldn't understand the explanations provided by the slide, so I had to do very extensive external learning through some websites on the Internet to understand some parts of the lecture.I want to make the slides more appropriate, and when the slides and instructors explain the content, I want to make it clearer and easier to understand the content explanation.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .
