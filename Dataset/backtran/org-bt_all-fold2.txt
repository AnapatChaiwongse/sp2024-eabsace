Deciding to host onsite classes and her only appearing in online meetings is one of the worst experiences I have ever felt, sure, [instructor] may have health issues but could have hosted online classes. To add an insult to injury, [instructor] expresses dislike to many students because nobody listens to [instructor], but we do have a defense, there's nothing but [instructor] just reading things on the presentation slides so how could we stay focused on what is literally right there in the slide itself? While I do not like to say that [instructor] is redundant and useless, I and many others share the same opinion that there is almost nothing of value in really being engaged in [instructor] class, we have many other things that are important to deal with.The sentiment polarity of motivation is negative .

Giving assignments every week and group projects almost every week is too excessive, there is too much workload and those assignments are not really helpful for studying the course in my opinion.

I was also not able to memorize the whole structure and find myself very struggling with the subject.

I think that the instructor should explain the content in more detail because I was not able to understand several parts of the lectures. Also, I had trouble understanding the content in the slides because the connection between the topics in the slides is not clear and the explanation for several parts is complicated. Each slide introduced a new topic, and I was unable to see the overall picture of the topics and how this slide is related to the previous or the next. Also, as for the explanations, the way that the content is explained is quite confusing and give a clear explanation of the content. Several parts were standalone sentences that were difficult to connect with what the topic is about and the other parts of the explanation. I had to do quite extensive external learning through several websites on the internet to understand several parts of the lectures because I could not understand the explanations provided in the slides. I would like the slides to be better organized and the explanations of the content, both in the slides and when the instructor explains the content, to be clearer and more easily understandable.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

I would like the instructor to understand that the method of learning which [instructor] teach is not give student enough understanding for most of student in the class. Even thought some student can implement the project as the requirement, it is because he/she have to seek more knowledge outside the class as instructor may have to consider why most of the student in the class cannot reach the requirement of the project, why they cannot delivered the project which using only the knowledge they learned in the class should be enough. As a result, I would love to let the instructor and faculty know that [instructor] is a kind, good person, and [instructor] can give a good advise with a good intention, but sometime it required morethan that to make the good class.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

It's difficult install [software] on Unix based devices, especially with the modern ARM processors, [software] only supports the x86_64 architecture.

I think that the instructor should explain the content in more detail because I could not understand several parts of the conferences. In addition, I had trouble understanding the content in the slides because the connection between the subjects of the slidesis not clear and the explanation of several parts is complicated. Each slide has introduced a new subject, and I could not see the overall image of the subjects and how this slide is linked to the previous or the following.In addition, with regard to the explanations, the way the content is explained is quite confusing and gives a clear explanation of the content. Party parties were independent sentences difficult to connect with what the subject and the other parts of the'Explanation.I had to do external learning fairly extensive via several websites on the internet to understand several parts of the conferences because I could not understand the explanations provided in the slides.

I would like the instructor to understand that the learning method that [the instructor] teaches is not a sufficient understanding of the student for most of the students in the class.

I don't understand some parts of the lecture, so I think the instructor needs to explain content in more detail.Also, the connection between topics in the slide was not clear, and some parts were complicated, so I had a hard time understanding the content in the slide.A new topic was introduced on each slide, and it was not possible to see the whole picture of the topic or how this slide was related to the previous or next slides.Regarding the explanation, the method of content is very confusing, providing a clear explanation of content.Some parts were difficult to connect to the contents and other parts of the topic and other parts.I couldn't understand the explanations provided by the slide, so I had to do very extensive external learning through some websites on the Internet to understand some parts of the lecture.I want to make the slides more appropriate, and when the slides and instructors explain the content, I want to make it clearer and easier to understand the content explanation.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

Deciding to host onsite classes and her only appearing in online meetings is one of the worst experiences I have ever felt, sure, [instructor] may have health issues but could have hosted online classes. To add an insult to injury, [instructor] expresses dislike to many students because nobody listens to [instructor], but we do have a defense, there's nothing but [instructor] just reading things on the presentation slides so how could we stay focused on what is literally right there in the slide itself? While I do not like to say that [instructor] is redundant and useless, I and many others share the same opinion that there is almost nothing of value in really being engaged in [instructor] class, we have many other things that are important to deal with.The sentiment polarity of content quality is neutral .

The workload is simply too much. Having individual assignment every week on top of gorup assignment, every week, is simply just too much considering this term's subjects. Individual homework often consist of having to list the meaning of this amount of words which in my opinion, didn't help me gain knowledge and certainly not [course] knowledge. The assigments or project requirement are sometimes unreasonable. Having the same minimum requirement of pages in phase 2 of the project as phase one is just simply lazy on their part at best and malicious at worst, phase 2 of the project simply has less content than phase 1 by a mile and yet they still expect us to deliver the same amount of pages as phase one. I also have issues with the questions in midterm exam. I can't simply cannot make sense of some of the question they decided to ask us. Why would having us list the tasks of team prject member and rate them test my knowledge of [course]. How would letting us give meaning to some words in an open-book exam benefit us when we do jobs in the future. It also took me almost all of this semester time to just find the meaning and importance of [course] and it's not by the class or exam or project but simply by my own research. Also we do we need to do executive summary and summary to every group assignment when sometimes the content is just half a page.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

The workload is simply too much.

The same minimum requirement on pages in phase 2 of the project such as phase 1 is simply lazy and malicious in the worst case.Phase 2 of the project simply has less content than phase 1 by a mile, and yet we still expect the same amount of pages as the first phase. I also have problems with the questions in the intermediate test.that you have decided to put us. Why should we list the tasks of the Team PRJect member and evaluate you if we test my knowledge of [course]? How would we give us some words in an open book examinationif we do jobs in the future?

There are too many workloads.Every week, every week, individual allocation is too much, taking into account the theme of this term every week.In my opinion, individual homework is composed of the meaning of this amount of words that did not help gain knowledge.Assimilation or project requirements are sometimes unreasonable.Having the same minimum requirements of the pages of the project pages as a phase 1 is simply a negligible zy in the highest state, and the worst case is malicious, so the project phase 2 is 1 than phase 1.Although the mileage decreases, the United States is still expected to distribute the same amount of pages as phase 1.There is also a problem with the interim exam questions.We cannot simply understand some of the questions they have decided to ask.Why do we list the team's PRJECT members' tasks and evaluate our knowledge of [Course]?When working in the future, it is possible to make a profit to some words in the open book test.Also, over all of the time in this semester, just find the meaning and importance of the course, it is not a class, exam or project, but simply my own research.Also, if the content is on half the page, you need to execute executive summary and summary for all group allocation.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

The workload is simply too much. Taking an individual assignment every week in addition to the Assignment of Gorup, every week, it is simply too considering the subjects of this term. The individual task often consists in having to enumerate the meaning of this amount ofwords that, in my opinion, did not help me obtain knowledge and certainly not [the course] of knowledge. The project assignments or requirements are sometimes not reasonable. have the same minimum requirement of pages in phase 2 of the project as thePhase one is simply lazy on his part, at best, in the best case, phase 2 of the project simply has less content than phase 1 for a mile and still wait for us to deliver the same amountof pages that phase one. I also have problems with the questions in the mid -period exam. I can't simpand qualifying them to prove my knowledge of [course]? How to let us make sense of some words in an open book exam would benefit us when we do work in the future? It also took almost all this time to find the meaning and importance of [[course] and it is not for class, exam or project, but simply by my own research.

Why would having us list the tasks of team prject member and rate them test my knowledge of [course].

I also have problems with the questions in the intermediate test.that you have decided to put us. Why should we list the tasks of the Team PRJect member and evaluate you if we test my knowledge of [course]? How would we give us some words in an open book examinationif we do jobs in the future?

I want the instructor to understand that the method of learning that teach [trainer] does not give the student enough for most of the student in the class.

The workload is quite simply too much. To have an individual assignment each week in addition to the assignment of Gorup, each week, is simply too much given the subjects of this term. Individual duties often consist in having to list the meaning ofThis quantity of words which, in my opinion, did not help me to acquire knowledge and certainly not to [the course] knowledge. Adoptions or the requirements of the project are sometimes unreasonable.Phase 2 of the project that phase one is simply lazy on their part at best and malicious at worst, phase 2 of the project simply has less content than phase 1 of a mile and yet they always expect us to deliverThe same quantity of pages as phase one. I also have problems with the mid-term questions of the exam. I can't just understand some of the questions they have decided to ask us.The tasks of the team member and evaluate them test my knowledge of [courses]. How we allow us to give meaning to certain words in an open notebook examination we will benefit when we do jobs in the future.Also need almost all of this semester to simply find the meaning and importance of [courses] and it is not by class or examination or project, but simply by my own research.Summary and a summary of each group assignment when sometimes the content is only half a page.The sentiment polarity of instructor is neutral .

The workload is simply too much. Taking an individual assignment every week in addition to the Assignment of Gorup, every week, it is simply too considering the subjects of this term.
