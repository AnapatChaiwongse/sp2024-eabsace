[instructor] is a very good teacher for me. [instructor] always give a clearly feedback for my work. [instructor] reply the massage very fast which help me do the assignment smoothly. I so happy studying in [instructor]  class.??????organizationneutral
The deadline for homework is too fast. I think the teacher should give more time to do the homework in order to give me time to learn and practice more.(I such a slow person to understand Math, It is hard to do a lot of questions within 00.00 am deadline)instructorneutral

The workload is unbalanced and too much to handle. Some assignment is not nectary and waste time. Some individual assignments look like one project. Moreover, the requirement of the project and weekly assignment is not efficient such as the report should have 20 pages, Summarize must be more than two pages. I think the number of pages can not reflect any quality of work and knowledgeorganizationnegative

I rarely learn about what really [course] is, I got only the meaning of each term and does not get any feedback from the submitted assignment, I have learned almost nothing and the instructor seems not to care about how students will feel about her because I do not see any changes from the previous comments.No offense to any instructors, but as far as I am concerned, not many people are interested in the class, and the class attendance has been abysmal.

[instructor] teachings are quite confusing, yes, the [course] subject itself is very hard, but [instructor] style of teaching makes it quite hard to understand the meaning, add to that the slides are not quite detailed and vague in meaning. One particular unbelievable moment is giving assignments a week before an exam, yes, the assignment is useful but at least give us that final assignment much earlier than that.organizationnegative

I think this course is very good, and I like it so much. Aj teaches and treats very well.organizationneutral
I would like this course to be more practical. It is mostly about the theory, which cannot engage students to learn more about [course] even though it is fun and useful in real life. I wish it to focus more on the real implementation and reduce the theory part.motivationnegative

Deciding to host onsite classes and her only appearing in online meetings is one of the worst experiences I have ever felt, sure, [instructor] may have health issues but could have hosted online classes. To add an insult to injury, [instructor] expresses dislike to many students because nobody listens to [instructor], but we do have a defense, there's nothing but [instructor] just reading things on the presentation slides so how could we stay focused on what is literally right there in the slide itself? While I do not like to say that [instructor] is redundant and useless, I and many others share the same opinion that there is almost nothing of value in really being engaged in [instructor] class, we have many other things that are important to deal with.instructorneutral
The teacher gives the work every week and gives time to send by midnight on the day of the work. There is no answer or answers whether the homework that has been done and sent correctly or not.content qualityneutral
Would like to have a link that can write and edit the group listSo that some students who do not have a group can know that there are no groups and request to join the group with other groups.instructorneutral
[instructor] should tell the student about the project at least two weeks before the final exam. [instructor] also should not give any assignments during the final exam. I can understand it is the practice but it would be better if it has a solution for the student.

[instructor] is impolite sometimes, teaches not well, very little people show up in the class because they have no clue what they're studying and they do not find learning with  [instructor] enjoying or easily understandable.

Everyone should have an Extra Point.

Giving assignments every week and group projects almost every week is too excessive, there is too much workload and those assignments are not really helpful for studying the course in my opinion.

I strongly suggest to tackle real-world practical examples, applying the theory learned in-classroom. That will make the acquired knowledge “more tangible”.Some topics are very subjective and, as the lemma of our university reminds us…, the true success does not lie in the leatning, but in its real-life application (imagination accompanied with in-class knowledge).The instructors ate great. Maybe it is just a shortage of time.Thank you Cordially, [student]instructorpositive
