Deciding to host onsite classes and her only appearing in online meetings is one of the worst experiences I have ever felt, sure, [instructor] may have health issues but could have hosted online classes. To add an insult to injury, [instructor] expresses dislike to many students because nobody listens to [instructor], but we do have a defense, there's nothing but [instructor] just reading things on the presentation slides so how could we stay focused on what is literally right there in the slide itself? While I do not like to say that [instructor] is redundant and useless, I and many others share the same opinion that there is almost nothing of value in really being engaged in [instructor] class, we have many other things that are important to deal with.The sentiment polarity of motivation is negative .

Giving assignments every week and group projects almost every week is too excessive, there is too much workload and those assignments are not really helpful for studying the course in my opinion. The group report may be a bit too harsh on minimum pages when there are not enough requirements on what content should be in report.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .
Thank you for teaching this good.The sentiment polarity of instructor is positive .

I was also not able to memorize the whole structure and find myself very struggling with the subject. However, one night, through my compassion and a liter of coffee, I decided to revise the material from [course]  from last semester from the beginning focusing on how [topic] works. I find that it is easier for me to study [course] knowing what and how data was sent from each layer.The sentiment polarity of motivation is positive .

Your teaching styles were easy to understand. (:D)The sentiment polarity of content quality is neutral .
I think that the instructor should explain the content in more detail because I was not able to understand several parts of the lectures. Also, I had trouble understanding the content in the slides because the connection between the topics in the slides is not clear and the explanation for several parts is complicated. Each slide introduced a new topic, and I was unable to see the overall picture of the topics and how this slide is related to the previous or the next. Also, as for the explanations, the way that the content is explained is quite confusing and give a clear explanation of the content. Several parts were standalone sentences that were difficult to connect with what the topic is about and the other parts of the explanation. I had to do quite extensive external learning through several websites on the internet to understand several parts of the lectures because I could not understand the explanations provided in the slides. I would like the slides to be better organized and the explanations of the content, both in the slides and when the instructor explains the content, to be clearer and more easily understandable.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

I would like the instructor to understand that the method of learning which [instructor] teach is not give student enough understanding for most of student in the class. Even thought some student can implement the project as the requirement, it is because he/she have to seek more knowledge outside the class as instructor may have to consider why most of the student in the class cannot reach the requirement of the project, why they cannot delivered the project which using only the knowledge they learned in the class should be enough. As a result, I would love to let the instructor and faculty know that [instructor] is a kind, good person, and [instructor] can give a good advise with a good intention, but sometime it required morethan that to make the good class.The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

It's difficult install [software] on Unix based devices, especially with the modern ARM processors, [software] only supports the x86_64 architecture. I think there are plenty of alternatives that natively support both x86_64 and arm64 chipsets (maybe the ones that are web based or written in java), as running Netica through emulation causes the program to be unstable and crashes alot (Tested on x86_64 Suse Tumbleweed and arm64 Windows, there are cases where my friends with m1 macbooks aren't able to install at all).The sentiment polarity of motivation is neutral .

This class is the least enjoyable class in this semeseter. The weekly assignment in my opinion is not nessecary. This class's assignment is too heavy, and it takes up most of the time I have spent in this semester. So much work for so few credits, not to mention that the content is scattered all over the place, with some overlapping with computer networking and software engineering. I think this class has potential but by the way it is planned right now, theres too much unnessecary workload and too much contents.

[instructor] teachings are quite confusing, yes, the [course] subject itself is very hard, but [instructor] style of teaching makes it quite hard to understand the meaning, add to that the slides are not quite detailed and vague in meaning.
